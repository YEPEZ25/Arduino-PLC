In the first test, the analogWrite() function in the code is used to generate the PWM signal which is then converted to an analog signal from 0 to 10 VDC. This allows the frequency of the drive to be adjusted in a controlled and precise manner.
In the second test, the Arduino code manages the activation of the contactor by means of an input signal already conditioned by the AC to DC converter circuit. For this purpose, a latching mechanism is implemented. This system allows the Arduino to memorize the state of the input pin so that upon receiving an activation signal (pulse) the output pin remains activated even after the input signal has been interrupted. The code logic is designed so that pressing the button again unlatches the system, deactivating the output pin. This behavior is repetitive: the contact alternates between activation and deactivation with each successive push of the button.

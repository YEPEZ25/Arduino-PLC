# Low-cost Arduino-based platform for education in Industrial Automation

In the field of automation education, there has been a growing interest in the implementation of didactic platforms, allowing students to acquire practical knowledge about industrial automation, therefore, the Spanish Committee of Automatics (CEA) promotes research and education in this area, the CEA seeks new methodologies and tools to facilitate the learning of complex concepts of automation and control, especially in educational environments.
In this context, this paper focuses on the creation of a low-cost platform for teaching industrial automation.

The proposed design adapts the general purpose input/output (GPIO) pins of an Arduino type board to be able to handle AC signals (110/220 VAC) and to condition its pulse width modulation (PWM) outputs to generate analog signals up to 10 VDC, required in industrial applications.
Experimental tests showed that the system achieves a maximum error of only 0.68\%, which highlights its accuracy and stability. This accuracy makes the platform an ideal solution for interfacing with industrial equipment such as variable frequency drives, and ensures its applicability in global industrial environments.

This approach integrates the automation education research promoted by CEA and other experts in the field, highlighting how this flexible, low-cost platform can serve as an efficient and safe educational tool. The results obtained demonstrate that this solution offers students the opportunity to understand and experiment with industrial automation by integrating open source technologies into practical, real-world applications.
